## What I learned
This project helped me understand how to relate parent and child elements, especially when it comes to spacing and alignment. I practiced controlling layout by using display: grid and display: flex in different sections, and learned how padding and margin behave differently depending on whether they’re applied to the parent or the child.

Example snippet:

css
.card {
  display: grid;
  place-items: center;
  padding: 15px;
  border-radius: 15px;
}
This made it easy to center content both vertically and horizontally while keeping consistent spacing.

## Continued development
In future iterations, I’d like to:

Add hover and focus states for interactive elements.

Introduce more intricate effects, such as changing the shape of the card on hover.

Experiment with CSS transitions and animations for a more dynamic feel.

Explore responsive typography so text scales smoothly across devices.

## Useful resources
Google Search – Helped me quickly find syntax references, layout techniques, and design inspiration.
